## Core Concept

GID organizes all components of a software project—feature requirements, components, interfaces, data models, code files, tests—and their relationships into a **queryable graph** that serves as the project's Single Source of Truth.

```
Graph = Nodes + Edges

Nodes: Feature, Component, Interface, Data, File, Test
Edges: implements, depends_on, calls, reads, writes, tested_by
```

**Minimum Viable Example:**
```yaml
nodes:
  UserRegistration: { type: Feature }
  UserService: { type: Component }
  OrderService: { type: Component }

edges:
  - { from: UserService, to: UserRegistration, relation: implements }
  - { from: OrderService, to: UserService, relation: depends_on }
```

## Why GID?

| Pain Point | GID Solution |
|------------|--------------|
| Impact analysis relies on memory | Query: Who depends_on X? Automatic, complete, repeatable |
| One-way direction (Bottom-up only) | Bidirectional: Change→Impact, Requirement→Task decomposition |
| Knowledge stuck in people's heads | Explicit knowledge, understand architecture by reading the graph |
| AI doesn't understand full system | AI comprehends dependencies via graph, generates accurate code |

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Impact Analysis**: What Features are affected by changing X
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Multiple symptoms → Find Common Cause
- **Development Planning**: Feature → Auto-decompose tasks
- **Test Planning**: Auto-generate required test runs
- **AI Collaboration**: Support Agent to Sub-agent task distribution

## Quick Start

### 1. Create graph.yml

```yaml
# graph.yml - Your project graph
nodes:
  # Business Features
  UserRegistration:
    type: Feature
    priority: core

  # Technical Components
  UserService:
    type: Component
    description: Handles user registration and login

  OrderService:
    type: Component

  # Data Models
  User:
    type: Data

edges:
  - { from: UserService, to: UserRegistration, relation: implements }
  - { from: OrderService, to: UserService, relation: depends_on }
  - { from: UserService, to: User, relation: reads }
  - { from: UserService, to: User, relation: writes }
```

### 2. Use Query Functions

```javascript
// Who depends on UserService?
getDependents(graph, 'UserService');
// → ['OrderService', 'PaymentService', 'NotificationService']

// What Features are affected by changing UserService?
getImpactedFeatures(graph, 'UserService');
// → ['UserRegistration', 'OrderPayment', 'Notifications']

// Find common cause
findCommonCause(graph, 'OrderService', 'PaymentService');
// → ['DatabaseService']
```

### 3. Progressive Adoption

| Level | What to Do | Time |
|-------|-----------|------|
| L0 | Understand concepts, model in your mind | 1h |
| L1 | Create graph.yml, maintain manually | 2-4h |
| L2 | Write query functions, do impact analysis | Half day |
| L3 | Use tools for auto dependency extraction | 1-2 days |
| L4 | AI-assisted component responsibility inference | As needed |
